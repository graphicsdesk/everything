## Tool Ideas

* Easy conversion of Google Docs text to code
  * Retains AML format but converts paragraphs, styles, and links to HTML
  * CLI to easily convert a Google Doc with an AML section into a scrollytelling piece (with different templates??!!)
* Starter CLI to easily access all templaltes (see [POLITICO](https://github.com/The-Politico/generator-politico-interactives), [The Pudding](https://github.com/the-pudding/starter/))
* Standard style template for interactive projects (like The Pudding starter for web pages)
* During compilation/building, putting sticky polyfill onto `position: sticky` objects with dynamic uid's?
* ai2html
  * Adding backgrounds to text like in SVG
